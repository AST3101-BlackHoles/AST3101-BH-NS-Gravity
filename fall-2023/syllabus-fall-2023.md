# (AST3101) Black Holes and Neutron Stars : Gravity

We will use a [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/143024058-ast3101-blackholes-fall2023) to manage assignments. To use our [classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/143024058-ast3101-blackholes-fall2023), you must have a GitHub account. They are free, and you can [sign-up here](https://github.com/signup).

## Course Description

This course will cover many topics in the astrophysics of compact binaries as viewed with Gravitational waves (GWs) and other multi-messenger phenomena. Students will learn the basics of compact binary evolutions, black hole (BH) and neutron star (NS) phenomenology, and observational signatures of GW coalescences. Students will also learn modern data analysis techniques, including time-domain analysis, matched filters and maximum likelihood searches, and (hierarchical) Bayesian inference with applications to GW population inference, including cosmology and the NS equation of state.

There are no official prerequisites for this course, but students will benefit from familiarity with

  * Cosmology or General Relativity
  * Probability and Statistics
  * Basic coding in Python 

If you are uncertain whether you have adequate background knowledge for this course, please email the instructors before the beginning of the term.

## Reading Requirements

All required readings, including class notes, will be provided. Students will not need to obtain additional reading material from the library, although they may find the following useful:

  * [Carroll, *Spacetime and Geometry: an Introduction to General Relativity*](https://librarysearch.library.utoronto.ca/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma991105986805306196&context=L&vid=01UTORONTO_INST:UTORONTO&lang=en&search_scope=UTL_AND_CI&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&tab=Everything&query=any,contains,Spacetime%20and%20Geometry:%20An%20Introduction%20to%20General%20Relativity&offset=0)

## Course Work and Grading, Key Dates and Deadlines

There will be 5 assignments throughout the 6 week course. Each assignment will count as an equal fraction of students’ final grades.

Each assignment will consist of a brief summary of a reading and pen-and-paper calculations. Some assignments will include “computational laboratories,” in which students are expected to write code and plot their results. Partial credit will be given, but late assignments will not be accepted without prior approval.

Lecturers will be available during Office Hours once per week and may be contacted over email. See contact information above.

### Schedule

Lectures will be held on **Fridays from 2:10 - 4:00pm in AB113**.
